# Crochet Calculator

#### By Sidney Hopkins

#### Calculator that determines the number of chain stitches needed for a crochet project.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Description

This application allows users to input the number of stitches in a small swatch of their desired crochet pattern, their desired project size, and the chain multiple for their pattern. The calculator generates the number of chain stitches they need for a successful crochet project.

Determining the correct number of initial stitches for crochet patterns is known to be difficult. If your chain stitches are off, you may find that the pattern you chose doesn't work out in the end, forcing you to push through a tough pattern or unravel a project. This calculator streamlines the process of calculating the chains and ensures you have the correct number.

## How to use

You can view the calculator and code on CodePen.
